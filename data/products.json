This is the first volume in what is sure to be one of the most coveted collaborations of the year.\n\nNow a major Sky Atlantic TV series from HBO, featuring a stellar cast.\n\n\n\nWinter is coming. Such is the stern motto of House Stark, the northernmost of the fiefdoms that owe allegiance to King Robert Baratheon in far-off King's Landing. There Eddard Stark of Winterfell rules in Robert's name. There his family dwells in peace and comfort: his proud wife, Catelyn; his sons Robb, Brandon, and Rickon; his daughters Sansa and Arya; and his bastard son, Jon Snow. Far to the north, behind the towering Wall, lie savage Wildings and worse - unnatural things relegated to myth during the centuries-long summer, but proving all too real and all too deadly in the turning of the season.\n\nYet a more immediate threat lurks to the south, where Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, has died under mysterious circumstances. Now Robert is riding north to Winterfell, bringing his queen, the lovely but cold Cersei, his son, the cruel, vainglorious Prince Joffrey, and the queen's brothers Jamie and Tyrion of the powerful and wealthy House Lannister - the first a swordsman without equal, the second a dwarf whose stunted stature belies a brilliant mind. All are heading for Winterfell and a fateful encounter that will change the course of kingdoms.\n\nMeanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, Prince Viserys, heir of the fallen House Targaryen, which once ruled all of Westeros, schemes to reclaim the throne with an army of barbarian Dothraki--whose loyalty he will purchase in the only coin left to him: his beautiful yet innocent sister, Daenerys.\n\nSource: Publisher"

        "en-US": "Dracula is a seminal work of horror literature that has captivated readers for over a century. Bram Stoker's novel is a masterful exploration of the human psyche, delving into themes of desire, fear, and the unknown. The novel's epistolary format allows readers to experience the story through the eyes of multiple characters, each with their own unique perspective on the events that unfold. At its core, Dracula is a story about the battle between good and evil. Count Dracula is a powerful vampire who seeks to spread his curse to others, while a group of determined individuals work to stop him. The novel's portrayal of evil is complex and nuanced, with Dracula serving as both a terrifying monster and a tragic figure who is cursed by his own desires. One of the most fascinating aspects of Dracula is its exploration of sexuality. The novel is filled with themes of seduction and desire, with Dracula representing a dark and dangerous form of sexual energy. The female characters in the novel are particularly interesting, as they are both attracted to and repelled by Dracula's power. Finally, Dracula is a story about the fear of the unknown. Stoker's novel was written during a time when scientific discoveries were challenging traditional beliefs about the world. The idea of a supernatural creature like Dracula was both terrifying and fascinating to readers, as it represented a world beyond their understanding. Overall, Dracula is a timeless work of horror fiction that continues to captivate readers today. Its exploration of themes such as good vs. evil, sexuality, and the fear of the unknown make it a complex and thought-provoking read that will stay with readers long after they finish the book.\nSource: Publisher"

        "en-US": "Walter Isaacson's worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin."

Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.\"\n\nWhen they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale? Only the dead are above suspicion."
