## How to Run the Project Locally ⚙️

_To run the project locally, follow these steps:_

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RSS-ECOM/rss-ecom`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd rss-ecom`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.example` and fill in your CommerceTools credentials
5. Run the project: `npm run dev`
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Git Workflow 🔄

This project follows a modified Git Flow workflow:

1. **Main Branch**: Production-ready code
2. **Develop Branch**: Primary development branch where all features are integrated
3. **Feature Branches**: Created from `develop` for specific tasks

### Branch Naming Convention

All branches should follow this pattern: `{type}(RSS-ECOMM-{sprint}_{issue})/descriptiveName`

Where:

- `{type}` is one of: feat, fix, hotfix, chore, refactor, revert, docs, style, test
- `{sprint}` is the sprint number
- `{issue}` is the issue number

Examples:

- `feat(RSS-ECOMM-1_01)/addProductPage`
- `fix(RSS-ECOMM-2_15)/correctCartTotal`

### Pull Requests

All code changes should be submitted via pull requests to the `develop` branch. PRs should:

- Have a descriptive title following the same convention as branch names
- Include a comprehensive description of changes
- Be reviewed by at least one team member before merging

## Environment Setup 🔧

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm 9 or higher

### Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.example` with the following variables:

```bash
# CommerceTools Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CTP_PROJECT_KEY=your-project-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CTP_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_CTP_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_CTP_REGION=eu-central-1
NEXT_PUBLIC_CTP_AUTH_URL=https://auth.eu-central-1.aws.commercetools.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_CTP_API_URL=https://api.eu-central-1.aws.commercetools.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_CTP_SCOPES=view_published_products:your-project manage_my_profile:your-project ...
```

Important: Never commit the .env.local file to version control.

### Recommended VS Code Extensions

For the best development experience, we recommend installing the following VS Code extensions:

- **ESLint** (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`): JavaScript linting
- **Prettier** (`esbenp.prettier-vscode`): Code formatting
- **Stylelint** (`stylelint.vscode-stylelint`): CSS/SCSS linting
- **GitHub Actions** (`github.vscode-github-actions`): GitHub Actions workflows syntax highlighting and validation
- **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** (`bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss`): Intelligent Tailwind CSS tooling
- **SCSS IntelliSense** (`mrmlnc.vscode-scss`): SCSS IntelliSense support
- **DotENV** (`mikestead.dotenv`): .env file support

## CI/CD Pipeline 🚀

This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Netlify for Continuous Deployment:

### Continuous Integration

Our CI process includes:

- Code formatting check with Prettier
- Linting with ESLint and Stylelint
- Type checking with TypeScript
- Testing with Vitest (when tests are available)
- Building the application

### Continuous Deployment

After successful merges to `main` or `develop`, the application is automatically deployed to Netlify.

### Dependency Management

We use [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) to keep dependencies up to date:

- Renovate automatically creates pull requests when updates are available
- Dependencies are grouped by type (e.g., Next.js packages, TypeScript, etc.)
- All dependency updates require approval through the Dependency Dashboard

## Working with CommerceTools 🛒

This project uses CommerceTools as the backend for e-commerce functionality. The connection is managed through the CommerceTools SDK.

### Authentication

The application uses Client Credentials flow for authentication with CommerceTools API:

```typescript
// In Next.js with prefix NEXT_PUBLIC_ secrets are available on the client
const apiKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CTP_PROJECT_KEY;

// For server-side components you can use ordinary variables
// If you don't want the secret to be available on the client, do not use NEXT_PUBLIC_
const apiSecret = process.env.CTP_CLIENT_SECRET; // only on server

// Basic usage example
import { apiRoot } from '@/lib/api/commercetools-client';

// Get products
export async function GET() {
  try {
    const response = await apiRoot.products().get().execute();

    return Response.json(response.body.results);
  } catch (error) {
    return Response.json({ error: 'Failed to fetch products' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

For detailed API documentation, visit the CommerceTools Documentation.
